# Codeview documentation

## Introduction

Codeview has been made to allow users to interact with the car by coding directly its movements. Anyone can become developer!

## Actions

To handle the controls of the car, we've added some keywords and actions that you can use in your code.
Currently, here are all supported actions: 
- go
- pivot
- wait

## Examples

The following code is an example of some actions you can combine to perform such moves.
```
go forward 3s
pivot 0.3s
wait 1s
go forward 7s
```
