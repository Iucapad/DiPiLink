# Discover Codeview

## Introduction

Codeview has been made to allow users to interact with the car by coding its movements. Anyone can become developer!

## Usage

You can access the Codeview editor from the application directly. You don't need to be connected to a device to start using it. You can simply write your scripts locally and save them for a later use. Go to the home page of the app and choose the Codeview option, or visit the web version of the editor available online [here](https://saison.one/apps/dipilink).

## Actions

To handle the controls of the car, we've added some keywords and actions that you can use in your code.
Currently, here are all supported actions: 
- go
- pivot
- wait

## Examples

The following code is an example of some actions you can combine to perform such moves.
```
go forward 3s
pivot 0.3s
wait 1s
go forward 7s
```
